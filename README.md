# From NASA to Instagram ![Instagram Post](https://github.com/dreygur/NASA-Insta/workflows/Instagram%20Post%20JS/badge.svg)
Don't panic! It's not a story of someone moving from NASA to Instagram.
It is a simple Instagram bot that pulls data from api.nasa.gov and posts to instagram. Nothing special.

To use this as your own bot, simply fork the repo or clone it.
If you run it from command-line pass your username and password as arguments. For running as cronjob you may write a shellscript or something like that.
It also can be used with github-actions. You just have to add two secrets in your repository settings as user and pass.
